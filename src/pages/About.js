          <h1>Alexander Harris</h1>
          <p>Hi there, my name is Alexander. I'm a <span> passionate learner</span> who loves to <span>problem solve</span>,
             and be great at anything I tackle.
             Prior to General Assembly, I worked at Apple where there was 
             constant <span>collaboration</span> between employees of all levels. The most important fundamental skill 
             I learned there was the ability to adapt and learn something new. Apple is a powerhouse of ingenuity
             and this has forever impacted how adaptable I am to new information. I feel this has lead me to the world of
             coding. The constant cycle of learning has kindled my passion for coding. <span>What makes coding
             so amazing for me is the ability to impact others</span> and give people ways to display who they are and what they want to show the world.
             I want to be a person that builds someone up and puts a spotlight on them, but never myself. To uplift other people's vision is my dream
             in the coding world!
        </p>
